            "hi everyone welcome back to the channel my name is prian sharal in this video I am going to tell you how you can get started with competitive programming and before I tell you a complete road map to get started with CP it is important for you to know why am I credible enough to talk about this topic so I am an incoming ICPC World finalist ICPC is like the Olympics of competitive programming apart from this I got an India rank of one and a global rank of six in Google Kickstart uh apart from this I am also a master on code forces which is equivalent to being among the top 0.1% competitive programmers in India overall I have been practicing and teaching competitive programming for almost 3.5 years now right and I also run a startup around competitive programming itself which is called TL Eliminator so what exactly is competitive programming first of all it is a mind sport in this mind sport you are given coding problems you are given some abstract puzzles or abstract problem statements you need to come up with an algorithmic or you know a logical solution to these problems U and you need to write code for that you just don't solve Standalone problems you you actually end up attempting contests right so in a particular contest there are certain problems that are given to you now the person who solves the most number of problems that person is ranked the highest if there are five people who solve the same number of problems in a contest then the person who solves them fastest is ranked the highest right now for every single platform like code forces Cod Chef all of these you will have a rating that will be assigned to you right for example my rating on code forces is 2188 if I perform well in a contest that rating is going to go up if I perform worse in a contest that rating is going to come down so my skill level in competitive programming can be also judged by that rating that I have on any given platform so that is how this whole entire field is competitive now the question is that why should you do CP right overall most of the competitive programmers if you ask them what is it that keeps you going at competitive programming it is the dopamine boost okay every single problem that you solve gives you a level of satisfaction and that satisfaction level only increases as you solve more and more problems secondly why you should do CP is that uh CP helps you improve your problem solving skills now another big reason why people do CP is that you know uh it helps you develop a very good resume like I mentioned you have a rating on every single coding platform apart from this all of these contests that you know keep happening like Google Kickstart ICPC Facebook hacker cup all of these contests whenever you get a good rank you can put it in your resume and that clearly shows the interviewer that okay you are a very good Problem Solver another reason why people do CP is that you know it gives you a huge Edge above your peers in online coding tests so whenever you look at these uh tech companies that are hiring like Google Microsoft uh Amazon uh Uber all of these companies so what they do is that they have two parts in their hiring process one is the coding test the second is the interview right in the coding test their main aim is to reject as many people as possible so they make the coding test very very difficult so what ends up happening is that people who are good in competitive programming they also end up performing very very well in these online coding tests and finally the main reason is that it is actually very fun okay once you start doing it after 3 4 months you kind of get addicted to it you get addicted to solving problems every single day right so now let's talk about what are the prerequisites that you need to have before you can actually get started with competitive programming the very first prerequisite is that you should be familiar with one programming language it doesn't matter which programming language you essentially choose U I just feel that if you're comfortable with any one of the programming languages you could continue with that but if you somebody who hasn't started learning programming at the moment I would suggest go for C++ it is firstly because most of the competitive programmers are doing CP in C++ so the chances of you finding help whenever you're stuck is the highest when you're doing it in C++ correct secondly C++ is much faster than other languages when it comes to runtime so essentially when you look at competitive programming every single problem has a time limit So the faster your code runs the better it is for you correct so it might happen that okay sometimes a C++ solution is getting accepted but the same Java solution or maybe the same python solution is getting a time limit exceeded error the second prerequisite is basic mathematics all that you require is simple High School level of mathematics not more than that just if you know that okay how does permutation combinations work how do you you know evaluate probability how do you look at multiples factors primes gcds lcms all of these things are very very basic and if you know just this much you are absolutely in a fine position to start competitive programming the third thing that you need before you can start competitive programming is to learn about online judges what are online judges whenever you write a code okay you will be submitting this code on some website and this website is going to evaluate whether your code is correct or not right so all of these platforms like code Chef code forces at coder these are online judges and these are competitive programming platforms so before you can get started with CP you must understand how these online judges work what are the various verdicts that you can get for every single submission like maybe your submission is accepted maybe your submission is rejected due to uh it being wrong or let's suppose it taking a lot of time to run right so once you understand all of these things that is the point where you should start CP before that if you go and start solving problems it would be very very demotivating for you lastly uh I just want to talk about this one thing that you don't need data structures algorithms to actually get started with competitive programming because you know whenever you start with CP the first initial set of problems those easy problems they are not going to be based on very heavy algorithms very heavy data structures okay they're going to be based on simple maths simple logic so you should learn data structures algorithms on the go whenever you encounter a problem which requires an algorithm you don't know about it so learn about it and then solve it right when you learn in this fashion you also tend to retain a lot okay now that you know what are the prerequisites to get started with CP let's actually talk about how do you get started so what you need to do is that you need to first of all start solving problems there are a huge number of problems on code forces code Chef all of these platforms how do we choose the right set of problems so as a beginner what you should do is that you should start by solving the easiest problems now if you talk about code forces the easiest problems are rated 800 as you increase the rating of the problem the difficulty of the problem also increases right so you should start by choosing 800 level problems on code forces once you get comfortable in 800 rating move to 900 once you become comfortable in 900 move to 1,000 right but as an intermediate level coder or as a master on code forces where do you start for this what you can do is you can follow this rule that okay whichever problem you're solving the absolute difference between your rating and the problem's rating should be within 200 okay what I mean by that is that if my rating is 2100 I would solve problems from 1900 rating to 2300 rating 1900 and 2,00 rating problems might be easier for me because my rating is already higher than them right but 2200 and 2300 level problems will be difficult for me finally I also get this question a lot from students that as competitive programmers should we be choosing topic-wise problems or should we be choosing random problems to solve now for this situation I would just say that if you already know which topics you are weak in then go for topic-wise problem solving otherwise you can go for random problem solving okay all right so now let's talk about how do you get started with attempting contests so as a beginner you should Target those contests which are beginner friendly okay so if I were to name a few beginner friendly contests firstly there are cach starters happening every single Wednesday then there is code forces division three and in fact division four also now code forces has recently introduced this division four concept where the problems are even easier than division three contests okay so these division three and division four contests on code forces are some of the most beginner friendly contests out there secondly you could also go for atcoder beginner contests which are again very very beginner friendly and apart from that you could also go for lead code weekly and bi-weekly contests another thing that I would suggest you all to do is to try out ICPC this is like the olymp ypics of competitive programming competitions and this is a competition that happens every single year but you can only participate in it uh when you're a college student okay so I would say just make the most out of this opportunity there is no prerequisite as such you just need to be a normal competitive programmer you need to have a team of three people from the same college and that's all okay so highly highly recommend you to go for ICPC now there are some tips that I have for you for contests uh firstly is to you know attempt a complete contest never quit the contest in between generally competitive programming contests are about 2 to three hours so what people do is that they attempt a contest for an hour and then when they feel that okay they are not able to solve more problems they just quit Okay let me tell you that if you want to get the most out of a contest you will have to attempt it completely because at the end of the day the more problems you solve in a contest the better rank you get right right secondly don't be you know obsessed with problems if you're stuck on a problem it is always a better choice to you know read at least the next few problems and think whether you can solve them additionally don't be obsessed with the ratings okay the ratings that you are obsessed with right now they're not going to matter in the long run for example in my case the very first 10 contests that I attempted on code forces they were just terrible but now when I look at it in the longer run like after attempting almost 300 contests on good forces that first initial set of 10 contests they don't matter to me at all now even if you look at my rating graph on code forces you will see that that small section of 10 contests it doesn't matter anymore right another tip that I have for all of you is to take breaks between the contests sometimes it happens that you're stuck on a particular approach with which is the wrong approach for a problem and we are not able to think of the right approach just because our mind is just fixated to to that one approach right so just get up from your desk maybe grab some chocolate you know uh have some snacks come back after 5 10 minutes okay if you do something like this you just entirely reset your mind and you start thinking about all other approaches for that same problem and most importantly you know uh make sure that you upsolve a contest what is the meaning of upsolve let's suppose you participated in a contest and you were able to solve two problems for the problems which you couldn't solve during the contest you you know that okay these are tough problems you don't have the right skills or maybe your mind was not thinking properly during the contest to solve these problems right after the contest is over when you look at the editorial for these problems you will realize that okay there are certain Concepts that you don't know or let's Suppose there are certain you know um directions in into which you never thought right so when you attempt the next contest your mind or you yourself will be much more equipped now in case you are somebody who struggles in UPS solving contests don't worry on tle eliminators YouTube channel after every code for contest WE Post our video solution I do have some more bonus tips for all of you but before that let me tell you about TL eliminators so this is a startup that I have been running around competitive programming we provide competitive programming training to students uh We've taught more than 4700 programmers till date first of all you know we've divided this entire competitive programming training into four levels level one is for absolute beginners who don't know any programming language so we start with basics of C++ we tell them how online judges work we tell them about time and space complexity all of these things right level two is for people who know at least one programming language and who've tried a bit of competitive programming similarly when you go for level three we teach them even more advanced stuff like binary searching on answer interactive problems Advanced number Theory right all of these things and as you go for level four uh this is the place where we expect a lot from you like we do expect that you are in a position where you can solve at least three problems in every single code forces around so in this level we teach you some very high advanced level Concepts like dynamic programming graph CS trees range queries right so essentially every single level is a 12 weeks long program uh every week we have around 1 to two Theory classes now let's say I've taken a class on Sunday on dynamic programming now from Monday to Friday I will be giving you daily practice problems on dynamic programming based on the topics that I've already taught you if you're stuck on any problem from or outside the course we have instant doubt support available the doubt support is handled by some of the highest rated coders in India uh these are people who are experts candidate Masters on code forces so if you are somebody who's rating 1 12200 or 1300 you will be guided by somebody whose rating is 1,700 or 1,800 on code forces right now we also believe that even after doubt support sometimes we are not able to solve the problem completely like sometimes we just need the entire solution to the problem right so for this we provide video solutions for every single practice problem that we give you right finally we also have certain other features like profile review sessions for example after every 1.5 month we will look at your code forces profile and we will actually analyze it in a lot of depth and we'll tell you where exactly are you not doing things correctly what are the things that you're doing correctly right so this way you don't just get to learn topics and solve problems you also get a lot of mentorship fine apart from this if you're attempting contest on code forces Cod Chef we also provide live post contest discussion right so these are all the features at T eliminators we give a lot of emphasis on making sure that the quality is the best right while also ensuring that the price is as minimal as possible now in case you don't believe me on the quality aspect you could look at all the testimonials that are available on our website and not just on our website you can go on Twitter you can go on LinkedIn and just search for tle eliminators and you would find so many positive reviews so our next batch will be around the corner you could check it out so with that said let me also tell you about some best practices that you could use in your competitive programming journey to have a more fruitful journey and to you know reach your goals much faster right so the very first thing is to you know be a part of some Community like uh I understand that competitive programming as a skill is not very rewarding right every single contest you don't perform at the top of your skill right sometimes you have bad contest sometimes you have good contests so being a part of a community keeps you motivated it also keeps you aware for example you might not know that there is a contest coming up but somebody in the community might say that okay I am interested in this contest and you might get to know similarly if you are not attempting a contest and if you find so many other people in the same Community discussing about that contest next time you would want to attempt it right so in case you're interested in becoming a part of some competitive programming Community uh we have our own free tle community on Discord I would drop the link of that in the description and you could just check it out right the next thing that I want to tell you is that you know the growth that happens in competitive programming it only happens when you come outside your comfort zone when you solve those difficult problems when you upsolve those contest problems that you could not solve during the contest so if you're solving problems which are easy for you it is a clear indication that you need to increase your level if you're are not being able to solve more problems in a contest it is a clear indication that either you don't know some topic or you're not absolving enough right so always try to make sure that you come outside your comfort zone third tip that I have for all of you is to be consistent CP is not just competitive programming it is also consistent programming okay the more consistent you are at solving problems every single day attempting every single contest the better you will be as a competitive programmer it doesn't matter how many problems you're solving in a day as long as you're showing up every single day even if you're solving one problem every single day you're going to become consistent and slowly and slowly this number of problems that you're solving is going to increase but if you you know think about solving 200 problems you know in just a week and then skip CP for a month you will not be coming back to that same position where you left okay so the final tip that I have for all of you is that don't always compete and don't always compare okay this is a very very underrated thing we always feel that okay competitive programming is all about being better than others right yes it is about being better than others in a contest but when you're outside a contest it is more about collaboration than competition make sure that okay if your friends are having doubts if your friend needs help outside a contest you go out of your way to help them okay when you do something like this others in the community will also be encouraged to help you right so that was it for this video guys I hope you found this insightful and you're now in a position where you can get started with competitive programming you can start solving problems and you can start attempting contests okay thank you for watching and I would see you in the next video\n"
